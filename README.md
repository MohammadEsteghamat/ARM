## Key Features
1. **RISC Architecture**  
   - Simple instruction set with fewer instructions  
   - High execution speed  
   - Optimized power consumption  

2. **Energy Efficiency**  
   - Low power consumption, ideal for **battery-powered devices**  
   - Less heat generation compared to **x86 processors**  

3. **Thumb and Thumb-2 Instruction Sets**  
   - **Thumb:** 16-bit instructions to reduce memory usage  
   - **Thumb-2:** A mix of 16-bit and 32-bit instructions for optimized performance  

4. **ARM TrustZone**  
   - Security technology that separates **secure and non-secure execution environments**  

5. **Pipeline and Superscalar Execution**  
   - Uses **pipelining** for parallel instruction execution  
   - Some models support **Superscalar Execution** for enhanced performance  

6. **Different ARM Architectures (ARMv6, ARMv7, ARMv8, ARMv9)**  
   - **ARMv7:** Supports 32-bit architecture  
   - **ARMv8:** Supports 64-bit architecture  
   - **ARMv9:** Improved performance and security, designed for **AI and machine learning**
